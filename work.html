                    <p>Here's my first attempt at brand creation and packaging design, completed as part of a weekend-long Makeathon for one of my clubs.</p>
                    <p>The idea was to create a brand with sustainable packaging that saved students and working people the time, money, and energy it takes to keep refueling on days or nights they really need to.

                    <p>This is healthE, an app that aims to improve a user's personal health as well as the overall health of the environment by tracking aspects of life that falls into this intersection.</p>
                    <p>Unfortunately, midway through coding healthE, my partner and I realized that while its intentions were good, we were creating with a solution (rather than a problem) in mind. We hadn't spent enough time researching the problem and whether a tracking app was the best way to improve personal and environmental health.</p>

                <p> As a lost and indecisive freshman, the motivation behind it was to create a webpage that would help me figure out where to study on campus.</p>
