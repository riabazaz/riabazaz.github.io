					<p>This is healthE, an app that aims to improve a user's personal health as well as the overall health of the environment by tracking aspects of life that falls into this intersection.</p>
					<p>Unfortunately, midway through coding healthE, my partner and I realized that while its intentions were good, we were creating with a solution, rather than a problem, in mind. We hadn't spent enough time researching the problem and whether a tracking app was the best way to improve personal and environmental health.</p>
					<p>Check out our screens created on Figma anyways.</p>

					<p>This is what I'm currently working on.</p>
					<p>I'm someone who loves working out but actively dislikes sitting down and planning my own workouts. Thus, BrainTrain was born. An app that learns off of your old workouts to create new ones for you. </p>
					<p> Written in Swift 5 with a Firebase Database.</p>

					<p>This was my first project, Study Spots.</p>
					<p>	As a lost and indecisive freshman, the motivation behind it was to create a webpage that would help me figure out where to study on campus.</p>
					<p> I learned about and used numerous Google APIs throughout this project. Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a MySQL Database.</p>
