This was my first project, Study Spots.

As a lost and indecisive freshman, the motivation behind it was to create a webpage that would help me figure out where to study on campus.

I learned about and used numerous Google APIs throughout this project. Written in HTML, CSS, and Javascript with a MySQL Database ([Github](https://github.com/riabazaz/locations)).
