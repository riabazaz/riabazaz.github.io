This is healthE, an app that aims to improve a user's personal health as well as the overall health of the environment by tracking aspects of life that falls into this intersection.

Unfortunately, midway through coding healthE, my partner and I realized that while its intentions were good, we were creating with a solution (rather than a problem) in mind. We hadn't spent enough time researching the problem and whether a tracking app was the best way to improve personal and environmental health.
