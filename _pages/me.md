- Sparring at [Sitkiatnin Muay Thai](https://www.sknmuaythai.com/) or [Chicago Muay Thai](https://www.chicagokickboxingclub.com/)
- Eating the same breakfast I’ve had every day for the past 7 years (really)
- Beep booping
- Memorizing the lyrics to every Bizarrap collab
- Plotting my next solo travel to a tropical location so I can have access to all the fruits (previous solo adventures include San Juan del Sur, Madeira, Puerto Escondido, Rio de Janeiro + more)
- Attempting to do the cossack squat + hip rotation combo so some day I’ll be the most flexible 70 year old you know
